# ArmPi FPV Servo Communication Issue Report

## Issue Summary
The ArmPi FPV servo communication system is not responding to serial commands. The Hiwonder SDK software is working correctly, but no hardware is responding on the serial interface.

## Technical Details

### Environment
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi (ARM64)
- **OS**: Linux 6.14.0-1007-raspi
- **Python**: Python 3.x
- **SDK**: Hiwonder ArmPi FPV SDK (ros_robot_controller_sdk.py)

### Serial Port Configuration
- **Expected Port**: `/dev/ttyAMA10`
- **Baud Rate**: 1,000,000 bps
- **Protocol**: Custom Hiwonder serial protocol
- **Port Status**: ✅ Available and accessible

### Test Results

#### ✅ Software Tests - PASSED
1. **SDK Initialization**: Board class initializes successfully
2. **Serial Port Access**: Can open `/dev/ttyAMA10` without errors
3. **Communication Setup**: Reception enabled successfully
4. **Internal State**: Fake servo positions return expected values (500 for all servos)
5. **Error Handling**: No exceptions or crashes in SDK code

#### ❌ Hardware Communication Tests - FAILED
1. **Real Servo Reads**: All return `None` (no response)
2. **Servo Position**: Cannot read actual servo positions
3. **Servo Status**: Cannot read torque state, voltage, or temperature
4. **Command Response**: No response to test commands sent to serial port

### Diagnostic Commands Executed

```bash
# Test serial port access
sudo python3 check_servo_setup.py

# Test raw serial communication
sudo python3 test_serial_communication.py

# Check available serial devices
ls -la /dev/ttyAMA*
```

### Expected vs Actual Behavior

| Test | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Open Serial Port | Success | Success | ✅ |
| Initialize Board | Success | Success | ✅ |
| Enable Reception | Success | Success | ✅ |
| Read Fake Position | 500 | 500 | ✅ |
| Read Real Position | 0-1000 | None | ❌ |
| Read Torque State | True/False | None | ❌ |
| Read Voltage | 0-12V | None | ❌ |
| Read Temperature | 0-100°C | None | ❌ |

### Kernel Information
```
[    0.020259] 107d001000.serial: ttyAMA10 at MMIO 0x107d001000 (irq = 16, base_baud = 0) is a PL011 rev3
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### Software Status: ✅ WORKING
- Hiwonder SDK is properly implemented
- Serial communication code is functional
- No software bugs or exceptions
- Protocol implementation appears correct

### Hardware Status: ❌ NOT RESPONDING
- No hardware responding on `/dev/ttyAMA10`
- No data received from ArmPi board
- No servo responses to commands
- Serial port is available but silent

## Possible Causes

1. **Hardware Not Connected**: ArmPi board not physically connected to Raspberry Pi
2. **Power Issues**: ArmPi board or servos not powered on
3. **Wrong Serial Port**: ArmPi might be using different serial interface
4. **Wiring Problems**: Incorrect connections between board and servos
5. **Firmware Issues**: ArmPi board firmware not responding to commands
6. **Hardware Failure**: Defective ArmPi board or servos

## Requested Support

### Immediate Needs
1. **Hardware Connection Diagram**: Proper wiring instructions for ArmPi FPV
2. **Power Requirements**: Voltage and current specifications for board and servos
3. **Serial Port Verification**: Confirm if `/dev/ttyAMA10` is the correct port
4. **Firmware Status**: How to verify if board firmware is working

### Technical Questions
1. What is the expected response format from servos?
2. Are there any initialization commands required before servo communication?
3. What voltage should be applied to the servo power rail?
4. How can we verify the ArmPi board is receiving power and functioning?

### Testing Recommendations
1. Provide a simple hardware test procedure
2. Share expected serial communication patterns
3. Include troubleshooting steps for common hardware issues
