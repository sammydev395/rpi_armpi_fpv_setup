# Follow-up Questions for HiWonder ArmPi FPV

## Current Status
✅ **Software is working perfectly** - Your SDK initializes and communicates without errors
❌ **Hardware not responding** - No ArmPi board or servos responding on serial interface

## Technical Environment
- **Platform**: Raspberry Pi 5 (ARM64)
- **Available UART**: `/dev/ttyAMA10` (PL011 UART at MMIO 0x107d001000)
- **Baud Rate**: 1,000,000 bps (as specified in your SDK)
- **Protocol**: Your custom Hiwonder serial protocol

## Specific Questions

### 1. Hardware Connection
**Which GPIO pins should the ArmPi board connect to on the Raspberry Pi 5?**

- Should we use the primary UART (currently `/dev/ttyAMA10`)?
- Or do we need to enable additional UART interfaces?
- What are the specific pin assignments for TX/RX/GND?

### 2. UART Configuration
**Do we need to modify the Raspberry Pi's UART configuration?**

Currently only `/dev/ttyAMA10` is available. Should we:
- Enable UART0, UART1, UART2, etc. in `/boot/config.txt`?
- Use a different UART interface than the current one?
- Modify any UART settings (baud rate, flow control, etc.)?

### 3. Power Requirements
**What are the power requirements for the ArmPi board and servos?**

- What voltage should be applied to the servo power rail?
- What current capacity is needed?
- Should power come from the Pi's 5V rail or external supply?

### 4. Physical Setup
**What is the correct physical connection method?**

- Should the ArmPi connect via GPIO pins directly?
- Is there a specific connector or cable required?
- Are there any jumpers or switches that need to be configured?

### 5. Firmware Verification
**How can we verify the ArmPi board is working?**

- Are there any LED indicators that should light up?
- What should happen when power is applied?
- Are there any initialization commands required?

## Test Results Summary

| Test | Result | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| SDK Initialization | ✅ PASS | Board class creates successfully |
| Serial Port Access | ✅ PASS | Can open `/dev/ttyAMA10` |
| Communication Setup | ✅ PASS | Reception enabled, no errors |
| Hardware Response | ❌ FAIL | No data received from servos |
| Test Commands | ❌ FAIL | No response to protocol commands |

## Requested Documentation

1. **Hardware Connection Diagram** - Step-by-step wiring instructions
2. **UART Configuration Guide** - Which UART interface to use and how to configure it
3. **Power Supply Specifications** - Voltage, current, and connection requirements
4. **Troubleshooting Guide** - How to verify hardware is working correctly

## Next Steps

Once you provide the connection details, we can:
1. Configure the correct UART interface
2. Connect the hardware properly
3. Power the system correctly
4. Test the servo communication
